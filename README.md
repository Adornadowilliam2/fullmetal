# Fullmetal Alchemist - Summary

## Overview

**Fullmetal Alchemist** is a critically acclaimed manga series written and illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa, serialized from 2001 to 2010. It follows the journey of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, in a richly developed world where alchemy is a scientific discipline. The series has inspired two anime adaptations, with the most notable being **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**, which closely follows the original manga.

## Plot Summary

The story begins in the early 20th century in the fictional nation of Amestris. After the tragic loss of their mother, Edward and Alphonse attempt to use alchemy to bring her back to life, violating the fundamental law of equivalent exchange. The failed ritual results in Edward losing his left leg and Alphonse losing his entire body. In a desperate move, Edward sacrifices his right arm to bind his brother's soul to a suit of armor.

Determined to restore their bodies, the brothers embark on a quest to find the **Philosopher's Stone**, a powerful object believed to amplify an alchemist's abilities beyond the laws of equivalent exchange. As they travel, they encounter a wide array of characters, including fellow alchemists, military personnel, and the mysterious homunculiâ€”artificial beings with their own motives.

Throughout their journey, Edward and Alphonse uncover dark secrets about the Philosopher's Stone, the nature of humanity, and the moral implications of their pursuits. The series delves into themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the consequences of ambition, leading to a climactic confrontation with forces that threaten their world.
